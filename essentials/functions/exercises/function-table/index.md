## Problem

Create a program that prints the values of a function `f(x) = x²` on the interval [−3, 3] with the step 0.1.

## Example

The program should print a two-column output, where the value in the first column is `x`, and the value in the second column is `f(x)`.

```
$ raku function-table.raku
-3	9
-2.9	8.41
-2.8	7.84
. . .
```
