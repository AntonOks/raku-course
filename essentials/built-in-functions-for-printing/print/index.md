title: The print routine

{% include menu.html %}

The `print` built-in routine does the following:

1. Converts its arguments to a string by calling the `Str` method on them.
1. Sends it to the `STDOUT` stream.

For simple data types, the output generated by `print` is similar to the output of [`say`](../say) without the newline character at the end.

```raku
print 42;
print 'Raku';
```

These values are printed one after another. There is no newline at the end of the whole output, too.

    $ raku t.raku
    42Raku

For aggregate data, the result may differ from what you see with `say`. For example, try arrays and hashes:

```raku
my @data = 'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma';
print @data;

print "\n"; # To separate the parts

my %data = alpha => 1, beta => 2, gamma => 3;
print %data;
```

This is how the output looks like:

    $ raku t.raku
    alpha beta gamma
    alpha	1
    beta	2
    gamma	3

The `print` routine can also be called as a method:

```raku
my @data = 'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma';
@data.print;

"\n".print;
```
