title: 'Exercise: Print the warning'

{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

Create a program that asks for your age and prints one or two warnings if the entered value is negative. Make sure the warning is printed to `STDERR`.

## Example

A couple of possible cases:

```console
$ raku print-the-warning.raku
What is your age? 20
Your age is 20

$ raku print-the-warning.raku
What is your age? -1
You entered a negative number!
```
