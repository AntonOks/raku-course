title: Embedded comments

{% include menu.html %}

Embedded, or inline comments, have the same form as multi-line comments with the only difference that you place it between other parts of the program. For example:

    my $name;
    $name = #`[User input expected here] prompt 'What is your name? ';
    say $name;

A good syntax highlighter helps a lot to visualize the presense of embedded comments.
