{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

Modify the program from the earlier [exercise ‘FizzBuzz’](/essentials/conditional-checks/exercises/fizz-buzz) to print the result for all integer numbers between 1 and 50. Each number appears on a separate line followed by `Fizz` and/or `Buzz`.

## Example

The first few lines are shown:

```console
$ raku fizbuzz-loop.raku
1: 
2: 
3: Fizz
4: 
5: Buzz
6: Fizz
7: 
8: 
. . .
```
