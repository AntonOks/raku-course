## Problem

Create a program that implements integer division via subtraction. The program has hard-coded numbers:

```raku
my $a = 175;
my $b = 25;
```

Complete the program so that it prints the integer part of `$a / $b`. Use a loop and subtraction only.

## Example

```console
$ raku division-via-subtraction.raku
7
