title: Infinite loops

{% include menu.html %}

The `loop` can also be used with only a body:

```raku
loop {
    say 'Eternity';
}
```

This loop is running infinitely until you terminate the program by, for example, pressing `Ctrl+C`. (We will have better ways to control the loop in the second part of the course.)
