title: Solution of â€™Hello, Concatenation!â€˜
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Code

Here is a possible solution of this problem:

    my $name = prompt 'What is your name? ';
    say 'Hello, ' ~ $name ~ '!';

ðŸ¦‹ You can find the source code in the file [hello-concatenation.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/strings/hello-concatenation.raku).

## Output

Run the program and it will enter a mode when it waits for your input. After you type the name and press Enter, the program continues and prints the greeting:

    $ raku exercises/strings/hello-concatenation.raku
    What is your name? John
    Hello, John!

## Comments

Compare the program with [the previous variant](../../../../scalar-variables/exercises/greet-a-person/solution) where we passed three strings to the the `say` routine:

    say 'Hello, ', $name, '!';

This time, the three parts are first concatenated and then passed to `say` as a single string.
