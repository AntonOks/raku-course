title: Solution to â€™Name lengthâ€˜
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Code

Here is the solution to the task:

```raku
my $name = prompt 'What is your name? ';
say $name.chars;
```

ðŸ¦‹ You can find the source code in the file [name-length.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/strings/name-length.raku).

## Output

Run the program and enter the name.

```console
$ raku exercises/strings/name-length.raku 
What is your name? Alexandra
9
```

## Comments

In this program, we are getting the length of the string by calling the `chars` method on the `$name` variable. As the variable contains a string, the method returns the length of it.

{% include nav.html %}
