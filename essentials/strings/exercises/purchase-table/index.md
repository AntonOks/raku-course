title: Exercise ‘Purchase table‘
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

Create a program to print the price table in the following format. Please use variables to store the prices and to calculate the totals.

    Item    Price   N      Total
    Chairs  $20.57  4      $82.28
    Tables  $50.18  1      $50.18

N.B. If you are not satisfied with the choice of the currency, feel free to use any other, but don’t forget that `$` [has special meaning](/essentials/strings/escaping-special-characters) in Raku strings, that’s why it was chosen for the purpose of learning Raku better.

## Example

This program does not take any input, so it prints the above table when your run it.

```console
$ raku purchase-table.raku
```
