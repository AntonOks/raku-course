## Problem

Remember our test program called ‘[Greet a person](/essentials/scalar-variables/exercises/greet-a-person/)’? Let us repeat it on a new level.

Write a program that asks the user for their name and prints a greeting. Use string concatenation in the solution.

## Example

If you run the program, you get a prompt:

```console
$ raku hello-concatenation.raku
What is your name?
```

Then you enter the name and get the greeting:

    Hello, Ella!
