{% include menu.html %}

Letâ€™s talk about strings. We already used strings in the previous programs. All of them are also called string literals. A string literal is some text in quotes:

```raku
say 'I am a string literal';
```

Of course, you can use a scalar variable to keep strings:

```raku
my $message = 'This is my message';
```

Let us see what other basic features we can learn about strings.
