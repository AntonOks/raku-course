title: Data type conversion

{% include menu.html %}

So far, we have seen a number of data types that Raku supports. Those were different kinds of [numbers](/essentials/numbers) (integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers), [strings](/essentials/strings), and [Boolean](/essentials/booleans) type. Each data type has its name in the Raku type system.

`Str` | String of characters
`Int` | Integer number
`Rat` | Rational number
`Num` | Floating-point number
`Bool` | Logical Boolean

There are more data types that Raku understands. We will see them in the further sections of this course.

## Exercises

Please do not skip the exercises after this section as they reveal some additional information about the data types of Raku.
