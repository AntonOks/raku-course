title: Converting types using type coercion methods
---

{% include menu.html %}

To convert, or to _coerce_ a type, call a method with the name of the data type. For example, convert a string into an integer number:

    my $howmany = '42';
    my $n = $howmany.Int;
    say $n;

In many cases, you don’t need to convert values explicitly, as Raku does that job for you. The following code is a working correctly and predictably:

    my $a = '10';
    my $b = '20';
    my $c = $a + $b;
    say "The result is $c."; # The result is 30.

The two variables, `$a` and `$b`, contain strings, but they are used in an arithmetical expression with `+`. At this point, both strings are converted to integers, and thus `$c` also gets an integer. In the last line, a variable containing an integer is interpolated in a string, so Raku does the necessary operations to present the number as a sequence of digit characters.
