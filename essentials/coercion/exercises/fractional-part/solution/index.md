title: 'Solution: Fractional part'

{% include menu.html %}

To get a fractional part of a number, you can subtract the integer part, which you can get by casting the number to an `Int`.

## Code

The possible solution is shown below:

```raku
my $n = 15.8972;
say $n - $n.Int;
```

ðŸ¦‹ Find the program in the file [fractional-part.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/coercion/fractional-part.raku).

## Output

```console
$ raku exercises/coercion/fractional-part.raku
0.8972
```

## Comment

Try the same program with negative numbers too, for example:

```raku
my $n = -15.8972;
say $n - $n.Int;
```

In this case, the result should be also correct:

```console
$ raku exercises/coercion/fractional-part.raku
-0.8972
```
