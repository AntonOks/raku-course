title: Solution of â€˜True and False stringsâ€™
---

{% include menu.html %}

This exercise is similar to [the previous one](/raku-course/coercion/exercises/true-false-numbers), but this time, the task is a bit trickier. There are more â€™suspectâ€™ strings that can be treated as `False`. Let us explore them.

    say ?'';

    say ?' ';
    say ?'        ';

    say ?"\n";

    say ?'0';
    say ?'0.0';

From all of these, only the empty string is casted as `False`. All other strings, even those that contain only spaces or an explicit character `0`, become `True`.

ðŸ¦‹ You can find the full program with the above example in the file [true-false-strings.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/coercion/true-false-strings.raku).
