title: Code blocks
---

{% include menu.html %}

Code blocks are fragments of your program enclosed in a pair of curly braces: `{` and `}`. They group a series of statements that work together as a kind of one big statement. We will see many use cases in the further sections.

```raku
{
    say 'Hello, World!';
}
```

The presence of a code block in this program does not add much sense, but code blocks are quite useful in other situations, which weâ€™ll cover very soon.

But first, let us examine the concept of _scope_.

{% include nav.html %}
