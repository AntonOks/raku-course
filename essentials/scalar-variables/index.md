title: Scalar variables

{% include menu.html %}

So far, the programs we saw contained text strings that were hard coded. Let us introduce a bit freedom and let the program use variables.

There are a few types of variables in Raku. A variable is a container that can keep some data in it. Weâ€™ll start with the simplest containers that can keep only a single value. Such containers are called _scalars_ or scalar variables. Any variable has a name which is prefixed with a special indicator of the kind of container, which is called _sigil_. For scalar containers, such a sigil is a dollar character `$`.

Here are a couple of examples of scalar variables:

    $name

    $age

{% include nav.html %}
