{% include menu.html %}

If you know the value that you want to put in a variable at the time the variable is created, you can gain a line of code and write it in a single statement:

    my $name = 'Anna';
    say $name;

## Multiple variables

To create and assign more than one variable, use the following pattern:

    my ($name, $age) = 'Carl', 36;

{% include nav.html %}
