title: 'Exercise: Purchase table'
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

Take the data layout from the exercise ‘[Purchase table](/essentials/strings/exercises/purchase-table)’ that you did earlier:

    Item    Price   N      Total
    Chairs  $20.57  4      $82.28
    Tables  $50.18  1      $50.18

Propose a data structure to store these values. Write the program to print it.

## Example

If you run the program, you should get the table shown above.

```console
$ raku purchase-table.raku
```
