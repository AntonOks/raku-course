title: Multi-functions

{% include menu.html %}

Raku offers multiple dispatch based on functionâ€™s signature. It allows to create more than one function that share the name but has different types of their input data. Use the `multi` declarator for each of the variants of the function.

```raku
multi sub add(Int $x, Int $y) { $x + $y }
multi sub add(Str $x, Str $y) { $x ~ $y }
```

(It is fine to omit `sub` if there is `multi`.)

Having the two variants of the same functions, the compiler will perform multiple dispatch depending on which arguments it sees in the function call. Compare the following two calls:

```raku
say add(10, 20); # 30
say add('10', '20'); # 1020
```

The first call triggers the function with integer parameters, while the second call runs the second variant of the funciton that expects two strings.
