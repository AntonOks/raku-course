title: Create variables of all known types
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Task

Write the program that creates a few scalar variables and initialises them with the values of the following type: `Int`, `Rat`, `Num`, `Bool`, and `Str`. The program should print both the value and its type.

## Example

The real output of the program may differ, but the idea is illustrated with the following test run:

```console
$ raku types.raku
151 (Int)
4.2 (Rat)
1e10 (Num)
True (Bool)
xyz (Str)
```
