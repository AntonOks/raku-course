title: Typed variables

{% include menu.html %}

In Raku, a scalar variable (or, a scalar container) can keep a single object of different types. For example, the same variable can first contain a number, and ten a string:

```raku
my $var = 42;
$var = 'Hello';
```

This is, probably, not the best coding practice, but it is a perfectly valid Raku program.
