## Problem

Create a program that computes the sum of integer numbers from 1 to 100 (including both 1 and 100) and prints it.

## Example

This is what the expected result of the program is (assuming we compute the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10):

```console
$ raku sum1-10.raku
The sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 55.
```
