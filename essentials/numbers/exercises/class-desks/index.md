## Problem

A school is preparing for the year after coronavirus and is going to order new desks. A desk is designed for two students. Given the number of students in the class, print the smallest possible number of desks that the school must buy for the class.

Use a variable to hardcode the number of students.

## Example

Here is the first line of the program:

```raku
my $students = 23;
# Your code here . . .
```

When you run the program, you should get the following:

```console
$ raku class-desks.raku
12 desks must be bought.
```
