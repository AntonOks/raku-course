title: Apple sharing

{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

_N_ people evenly distribute _K_ apples among them. Create a program that answers the following questions:

* How many apples every single person gets?
* How many apples remain in the basket?

The input numbers _N_ and _K_ should be hardcoded and assigned to the variables, for example:

```raku
my $N = 3;
my $K = 11;

# Your code here . . .
```

Consider the apples atomic, so you cannot cut them into pieces.

## Example

With the numbers given above, we expect the program to print the following:

```console
$ raku apple-sharing.raku
Each person gets 3 apple(s).
There are 2 apple(s) remaining.
```

At this point, ignore putting the nouns in the correct form and do not take into account a potentially awkward output when the remaining number is zero.
