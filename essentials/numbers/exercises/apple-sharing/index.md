title: Apple sharing

{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

_N_ people take _K_ apples and evenly distribute them among each other. The remaining part is kept in the basket. Create the program that answers the following questions:

* How many apples each single person gets?
* How many apples remain in the basket?

The input numbers _N_ and _K_ should be hard coded and assigned to the variables, for example:

    my $N = 3;
    my $K = 11;

    # Your code here . . .

## Example

With the numbers given above, the program is expected to print the following:

    $ raku apple-sharing.raku
    Each person gets 3 apple(s).
    There are 2 apple(s) remaining.

At this point, ignore putting the nouns in the correct form and do not take into account a potentially akward output when the remaining number is zero.
