title: Solution of â€˜The value of Ï€â€™
---

{% include menu.html %}

The program to print the value of Ï€ is simple enough.

## Code

    say Ï€;

ðŸ¦‹ You can find the full code in the file [pi.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/numbers/pi.raku).

## Output

Run the program and see what it prints:

    $ raku exercises/numbers/pi.raku
    3.141592653589793

## Comments

Raku already offers us a built-in constant called `Ï€`, which makes the program trivial. Nevertheless, consider other options of doing the same:

    Ï€.say;

Or:

    pi.say;

Or:

    say pi;
