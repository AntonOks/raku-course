# The solution of ‘The value of π’

The program to print the value of π is simple enough.

## Code

    say π;

🦋 You can find the full code in the file [pi.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/numbers/pi.raku).

## Output

Run the program and see what it prints:

    $ raku pi.raku
    3.141592653589793

## Comments

Raku already offers us a built-in constant called `π`, which makes the program trivial. Nevertheless, consider other options of doing the same:

    π.say;

Or:

    pi.say;

Or:

    say pi;
