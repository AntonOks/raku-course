Probably, this is not a kind of programs that you will create in your practice. Nevertheless, it is important to know the methods to introspect the parts of real programs.

## Code

One of the possible solution that creates the variables of the four mentioned types and prints their types is here.

```raku
my $a = 10;
my $b = 10.2;
my $c = 10e3;
my $d = 'ten';

say $a, ' ', $a.WHAT;
say $b, ' ', $b.WHAT;
say $c, ' ', $c.WHAT;
say $d, ' ', $d.WHAT;
```

ðŸ¦‹ Find the program in the file [types.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/data-types/types.raku).

## Output

This program prints the following output:

```console
$ raku exercises/data-types/types.raku
10 (Int)
