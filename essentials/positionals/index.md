title: Positional data types
---

{% include menu.html %}

It is time to talk about more complex data types. Positional data types in Raku are those that can be indexed (or _subscripted_). We already met with one of the representatives of this class of data type: [ranges](/essentials/ranges).

In this section, two more positional data types are introduced: `Array` and `List`. More in-depth information will follow up in the second part. We also take a second look at ranges in light of them being a positional data type.
