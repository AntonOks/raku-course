## Code 1

The straigtforward solution is to use the `**` operator.

```raku
my $n = @*ARGS[0];
say $n ** 2;
say $n ** 3;
```

ðŸ¦‹ Find the program in the file [squares-and-cubes.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/positionals/squares-and-cubes.raku).

## Code 2

A slightly more stylish solution is to use Unicode superscripts.

```raku
my $n = @*ARGS[0];
say $nÂ²;
say $nÂ³;
```

ðŸ¦‹ Find the program in the file [squares-and-cubes-2.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/positionals/squares-and-cubes.raku).

## Output

Run the program a few times and test it with different numbers.

```console
$ raku squares-and-cubes.raku 5
25
125
```
