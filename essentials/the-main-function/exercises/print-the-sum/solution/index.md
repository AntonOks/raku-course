{% include menu.html %}

This program consists of a single `MAIN` function that takes two typed arguments, both of each are built from the arguments from the command line.

## Code

Here is the solution:

```raku
sub MAIN(Int $a, Int $b) {
    say $a + $b;
}
```

ðŸ¦‹ Find the program in the file [print-the-sum.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/the-main-function/print-the-sum.raku).

## Output

Try different input numbers:

```console
$ raku exercises/the-main-function/print-the-sum.raku 500 700
1200
```

You can also try running the program without the arguments or with the arguments of different types and see what happens. Weâ€™ll talk about handling those cases in the second part of the course.
