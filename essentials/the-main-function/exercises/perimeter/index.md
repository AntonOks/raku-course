title: 'Exercise: Perimeter of a rectangle'

## Problem

Write a program that computes and prints the perimeter of a rectangle. Pass the lengths of two sides in command-line arguments. If it is a square, pass a single value. Use the `MAIN` function.

## Example

The program should explicitly confirm if it works with a square or a rectangle. Here is a possible output for the two cases:

```console
$ raku perimeter.raku 15
The perimeter of a square is 60.

$ raku perimeter.raku 15 20
The perimeter of a rectangle is 70.
```
