title: Using online services to run Raku
---

{% include menu.html %}

Online services do not require many explanations. Paste the text of the program into an online editor and press the `Run` button. You will see program’s output in a separate area. If there are some errors, you will see them too. 

Such services can often send data to your program’s input stream STDIN from a separate textarea. Sometimes, the output is also shown split into `STDOUT` and `STDERR`.

Here is a list of some of the services that support Raku:

* [glot.io](https://glot.io/new/raku)
* [TIO](https://tio.run/#perl6)
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/new/raku) (requires logging-in first)
* [RakuPlay](https://rakudist.raku.org/play/) (uses a queue)
