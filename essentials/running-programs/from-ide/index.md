title: Running from IDE
---

{% include menu.html %}

This section very briefly explains how you run the program without leaving the IDE for the two most recommended [IDEs](../../editors-and-ides).

## Visual Studio Code Editor

Open a terminal from the menu `Terminal` â†’ `New Terminal`. It will add a panel below your program text. Run the program as you do it from the command line:

```console
$ raku hello.raku
```

## Comma IDE

The running facility sits behind the `Run` menu item. Follow [the instructions](https://commaide.com/docs/running) at the Comma website on how to set up the IDE before the first run of the program.
