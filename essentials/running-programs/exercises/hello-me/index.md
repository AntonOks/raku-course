title: Exercise ’Hello, Me!‘
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

Create and run a program that prints a greeting with your name. Save the program in a file and run from the command line. If you prefer, you can [run the program](/raku-course/essentials/running-programs) online or directly from an IDE.

## Example

Here is an example of running the program and of its output:

```console
$ raku hello-me.raku
Hello, Andrew!
```

## Solution

Try solving this task yourself. Save the code in a file and pass it to the command-line interpreter or run it using other methods that we covered earlier. If you want to see the example, or if your program—for some reasons—does not work, you are welcome to check the working solution via the link below.
