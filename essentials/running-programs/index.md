{% include menu.html %}

In [one of the previous section](../hello-world), we created a simple program, but did not run it yet. There are four main ways of running the program: using an installed command-line tool, using a REPL shell, running a program directly from an [IDE](../editors-and-ides) or using an online service such as [glot.io](https://glot.io/new/perl6).

There are two five in this section. You can browse all of them or examine only those that you find suitable for your needs. After the sections, there is an assignment.
