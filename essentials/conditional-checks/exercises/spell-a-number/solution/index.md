The program below has a built-in array with the names of numbers from 0 to 20 and the names of the tens 20, 30, etc. In the chain of conditional checks, the number is distributed to a different algorithm to create and print a full spellt version of the number.

## Code

```raku
my $n = @*ARGS[0];

my @names = <
    zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
    eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fivteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
    thirty fourty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety >;

if $n < 20 {
    say @names[$n];
}
elsif $n % 10 {    
    say @names[$n / 10 + 18] ~ '-' ~ @names[$n % 10];
}
else {
    say @names[$n / 10 + 18];
}
```

ðŸ¦‹ Find the program in the file [spell-a-number.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/conditional-checks/spell-a-number.raku).
