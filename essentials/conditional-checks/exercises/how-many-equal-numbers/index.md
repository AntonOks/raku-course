## Problem

Create a program that takes three integer numbers from the user and tells how many of them are equal. The program should be able to work with both positive and negative numbers.

## Example

A possible run of the program is shown below:

```console
$ raku how-many-equal-numbers.raku
Number 1: 3
Number 2: -4
Number 3: 3
2
```

If all three numbers are different, the program prints `0`.
