title: given, when, and default
---

{% include menu.html %}

If the program requires more than one `elsif` checks, it is a good time to think of using `given` and `when` blocks instead. This construct is similar to the `switch` keyword in other programming languages.

Here is an example of using `given` and `when`:

    my $age = 'How old are you? ';

    given $age {
        when 
    }

{% include nav.html %}
