Containers in the Raku programming language serve to keep data, but their role and meaning are deeper and wider than just being a variable. This section gives an overview of different container types that are available for the developer in Raku.

It is crusial to understand the concept of containers, otherwise it may seem that in some cases the program uses, for example, scalars instead of arrays or vice versa.

Different types of containers can host data of different nature, size, or even different number of data items. Correspondently, different types of containers have their own sets of methods to manupulate the data. Visually, containers are distinguished with a sigil used. Learn more in the below pages.
