## Problem

You have a list of two-letter country codes in the array:

```raku
my @codes = < FR IT DE EE LV US CN IN BR >;
```

Complete the program to print the full names of these countries, one at a line. Use the file [cc.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/essentials/associatives/exercises/country-codes/cc.raku) with the hash that maps country codes to the names.

## Example

The program’s output is shown below. Only a few first names are shown:

```console
$ raku country-codes.raku
France
Italy
Germany
. . .
```
