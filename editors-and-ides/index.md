# Editors and IDEs

Programs in the Raku programming language are written as plain text and usually are kept in text files (the exception are the programs that you run online or in the command line or prepare to be executed via `EVAL` or some other rare cases).

It is assumed that the program source is a UTF-8 text. You can thus use any text editor that does not save formatting instructions in the document. While you can definetly use `vim`, or `nano`, or `emacs`, or `mcedit` and be happy with your choice, there are couple of currently trending applications that you may also want to try. These are:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux
* [Comma](https://commaide.com) — the Raku IDE that is built specifically for programming in Raku; available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
