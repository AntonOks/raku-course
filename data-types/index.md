# Data types

So far we have seen a number of data types that Raku supports. These are different kind of [numbers](/raku-course/numbers) (integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers), [strings](/raku-course/strings), and [Boolean](/raku-course/booleans) types. Each data type has its name in the Raku type system.

`Str` | String of characters
`Int` | Integer number
`Rat` | Rational number
`Num` | Floating-point number
`Bool` | Logical Boolean

There are not all data types that Raku understands. We will see more in the further sections of this course.

## Exercises

Do not skip the exercises after this section as they reveal some additional information about the data types of Raku.
