title: Solution of â€˜Examining the output of prompt â€”Â Stringsâ€™
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Code

Here is the complete program that does the job and prints both the entered string and its type.

```raku
my $name = prompt 'What is your name? ';
say $name;
say $name.WHAT;
```

ðŸ¦‹ You can find the source code in the file [prompt-strings.raku](https://github.com/ash/raku-course/blob/master/exercises/typed-variables/prompt-strings.raku).

## Test runs

Run the program a couple of times and enter different names. The program echoes the input and also reports that the variable contains a string, in other words, an object of the `Str` type.

```console
$ raku exercises/data-types/prompt-strings.raku
What is your name? Andrey
Andrey
(Str)
```

Now, run the program again, type a few spaces instead of a name, and press Enter.

```console
$ raku exercises/data-types/prompt-strings.raku
What is your name?    

(Str)
```

We do not see the output, but we see that the type of the variable is still `Str`.
