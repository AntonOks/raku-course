# Running from command line

Save the text of the program into a text file, for example, `hello.raku` and pass the path to the file to the command-line tool `raku` (the dollar character indicates shell’s prompt):

    $ raku hello.raku

If the program does not contain errors, it will be immediately executed, and if it generates any output, you will see the output in the terminal:

    $ raku hello.raku 
    Hello, World!
