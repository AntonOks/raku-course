# Hello, me!

## Problem

Create and run a program that prints a greeting with your name. Save the program in a file and run from command line. If you prefer, you can [run the program](/raku-course/running-programs) online or directly from an IDE.

## Example

Here is an example of running the program and of its output:

    $ raku hello-me.raku
    Hello, Andrew!


## Solution

Try solving this task yourself. Save the code in a file and pass it to the command-line interpreter or run it using other methods that we [covered earlier](../../running-programs). If you want to see the result, or if your program—for some reasons—does not work, you are welcome to see the working solution via the link below.
