# Running from IDE

This section very briefly explain how you start the program without leaving the IDE for the two most recommended [IDEs](../editors-and-ides).

## Visual Studio Code Editor

Open a terminal from the menu `Terminal` ‚Üí `New Terminal`. It will add a panel below your program text. Run the program as you do it from command line:

    $ raku hello.raku

## Comma IDE

The running facility sits behind the `Run` menu item. Follow [the instructions](https://commaide.com/docs/running) on the Comma website to set the IDE up before the first run of the program.
