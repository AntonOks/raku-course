title: 'Exercise: Odd indices'
---

{% include menu.html %}

## Problem

You have a array of numbers:

```raku
my @data = 10, 12, 1, 5, -9, 8, 36, 18, 21;
```

Complete the program to print only the elements with odd indices. Make sure the program still works if you change the number of items in `@data`.


## Example

```console
$ raku odd-indices.raku
12
5
8
18
```
