# About this course

This course covers all main aspects of the Raku programming language that you need to successfully use it in your daily practice. The course consists of separate chapters that explain the theory and offer a number of exercises. It is assumed that you solve the tasks before looking to the solution.

If you only start learning Raku, you are advised to go through all the chapters in the given order. If you have some practice and you want to have some specific training, you are welcome to start with the desired section.

To follow the course and run excercises, you need to have a working compiler. There are two options:

* Install the Rakudo compiler or the Rakudo Star package or
* Use online service such as [glot.io](https://glot.io/new/perl6).
