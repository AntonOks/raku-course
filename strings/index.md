# Strings

Let’s talk about strings. We already used strings in a number of previous programs. All of them are also called string literals. A string literal is some text in quotes:

    say 'I am a string literal';

Of course, you can use a scalar variable to keep strings:

    my $message = 'This is my message';

Let us see what other basic features we can learn about strings.

## Next steps

* [String concatenation](string-concatenation)
* [String interpolation](string-interpolation)
* [String length](string-length)
