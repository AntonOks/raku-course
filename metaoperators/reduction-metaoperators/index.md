# Reduction metaoperators

## Syntax

Reduction metaoperators are constructed using the reduction metaoperators, which is a pair of square brackets around the ‘regular’ operator.

# Triangular reduction metaoperator


## Problems

Solve the following tasks using reduction metaoperators.

1. [Sum of array](/problems/sum-of-array) — Add up the values of a array of integers.

1. [Factorial](/problems/factorial-metaoperator) - Compute a factorial of N.

1. [Concatenate a list](/problems/concatenate-a-list) — Take an array of strings and concatenate them to a single string.

The solution of the following problems should involve triangular reduction operator.

1. Print 10 first strings that you get out of English alphabet if you type together the first two, then the first three, then the first four, etc. letters.

1. For the numbers from 1 to 10, print the partial sums that you get by adding up all the numbers below 3, then all the numbers below 4, etc.
