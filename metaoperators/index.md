# Metaoperators

Metaoperators are the kind of wrappers around regular operators. With them, you can apply the same operator a number of times, or apply them to a number of data items. Explore the two types of metaoperators:

* [Reduction metaoperators](reduction-metaoperators)
* [Zip metaoperators](zip-metaoperators)
