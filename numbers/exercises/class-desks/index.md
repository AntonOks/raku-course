# Class desks

A school is preparing to the year after coronavirus and is going to buy new desks. A desk is designed for two students. Given the number of students in the class, print the smallest possible number of desks that must be purchased for the class.

Use a variable to hard code the number of students.

## Example

Here is the first line of the program:

    my $students = 23;
    # Your code here . . .

When you run the program, you should get the following:

    $ raku class-desks.raku
    12 desks must be bought.
