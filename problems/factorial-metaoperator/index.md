# Compute a factorial using metaoperator

## Problem

Create a function to compute a factorial of an integer number. The function should accept a positive number and return its factorial.

Use reduction metaoperator in the solution.

## Example

You program should be able to execute the following line of code:

    say factorial(5);

Here, `factorial` is the function you need to write.
