# Compute a factorial using metaoperator

## Problem

Create a program to compute a factorial of an integer number. The program should take an integer (hard-coded) and print its factorial.

Use reduction metaoperator in the solution.

## Example

You program should be able to execute the following lines of code:

    my $n = 5;

    # Your code goes here...

    say $factorial;

Here, `$factorial` is the variable to have to fill with the value of _5!_.
